    <p>The purpose of this game is to have fun trying to get to the top. 2 integral parts of the code were to use scrolly to have the background move and to use the egg variable to keep track of damage and lives. The main difficulty was making it so that the game wasn't laggy, and that was fixed by having many sprites rather than one with a lot of code in it.</p>
