    <p>The purpose of this game is to have fun trying to get to the top. 2 integral parts of the code were to use scrolly to have the background move and to use the egg variable to keep track of damage and lives. The main difficulty was making it so that the game wasn't laggy, and that was fixed by having many sprites rather than one with a lot of code in it.</p>

    <p>Interactive Fiction</p><br>
    <a href="https://repl.it/FBLh/15"><img src="images/story.jpg"></a><br>
    <p>Summary: Phuc's life sucks. He can either get married, go on a spcae adventure, or become a CIA agent. HOwever, he always ends up dying tragically.
    <br> Proccess: We had to use statements to make our story. Indentation was a nightmare. I am satisfied with this work. I love the story. THe coding needs work because it is case sensitive and there are gramatical errors. I like Minh Vinh Nguyen because the story is awsome. If I had to do this again I would do more proofreading.</p>
